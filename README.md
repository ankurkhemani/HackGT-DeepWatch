# HackGT-DeepWatch
Georgia Tech Hackathon project built as a native Android app.

## Inspiration
How many times does it happen to you that you are watching a video on Youtube/Netflix/Hulu/TV/etc and you can't recall the name of celebrity you see? Or how many times are you really interested in what the characters of your favortite tv-show are talking about in today's episode but are too lazy to look it up? So were we! And that's the reason we decided to build this hack.

## How I built it
We have built a native Android application using cognitive APIs from Microsoft. As soon as user taps the button, we capture the frame and speech in the vicinity to analyze them extensively ( **face detection, face recognition, speech-to-text, text analytics**) and bring out all the important attributes related to the scene.

## Prizes Won
Best Overall Hack
Best Microsoft Hack
